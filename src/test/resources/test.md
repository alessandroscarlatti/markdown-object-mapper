# a big set of test data

## comments
this stuff can't be parsed
all as a single string very easily
because it is on separate lines.
It becomes multiple blocks
in the syntax tree.

## more comments

```text
this stuff could be parsed because it is in a code block.
However, there will be no special formatting.
```

## the test data
```yaml
"the data": "whatever"
```
